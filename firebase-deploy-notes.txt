You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

irm your choices. Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: ib-af710 (iewd)
i  Using project project-xxxx (project)

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? dist                      >>>>> type 'dist
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes       >>>>> type y
? File dist/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No                          >>>>> type n
i  Skipping write of dist/index.html
